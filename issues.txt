Known Issues
==============

Critical
---------------
* Sometimes the load button for loading image stacks just flat does not work. Without changing the code it will spontaneously fix itself. Expect QSettings is to blame.

General
---------------
* Refactor filter_jeff.py and diplacement_jeff.py
* General refactoring as well as fixing todo items
* App crashes upon closing
* Application often shows as not responding during heavy processing
* If you hold down the down/up key on the pipeline list plugins pop up in a new window
* Prototype code contains future warnings (uses to be deprecated APIs)
* Project corruption warning not very descriptive
* cant delete file if you import and then open it in video player and then try to delete

Main User-interface
---------------
* The selectionModel used to list files always resets to the topmost file when navigating to a new plugin
* In Ubuntu there is no tick-box in the combobox used for filtering files
* Combobox selection isn't saved for each plugin. It shouldn't reset each time.
* Aborting a process doesn't work very well

Data management
---------------
* The source field tells you what video was in view for bulk processing, not which video it is from
* UI wont display full names (column widths static)
* Importing files other than image stacks untested
* Paramaters for plugins not stored. It shouldn't reset each time.

Auto ROI Placement
------------------
 * Sometimes the ROI's are incorrectly placed. Cause unknown however reloading the ROI's seems to fix it every time

Evoked Triggered Average
-------------------
* UI needs to be redesigned
* Untested

FileExporter
------------------
* Exporting to avi creates contour-ridden videos except for files that started as uint8
* Switching between types changes filename

ROI Creator
------------------
* Cannot save ROI's after moving them
* Mask import/export not yet implemented
* Deletion does not update immediately

Set Coordinate System
----------------
* coordinates loaded from csv or txt must be the of the same units as the units used for pixel width

Connectivity Diagram
----------------
* No warning appears when trying to craete a plot with seeds outside the ROI
* No option for (better) other colormaps

SPC Map
------------------
* ROIs cannot be saved from the SPC map window
* Cannot export numpy array of custom clicked seeds
* colormaps should be listed in a seperate script (make exstensible)
* Map window always in focus (cannot bring main window in front of it)
* In windows th gradient bar is stuck in the top left. Move the image and it moves to the right spot

Stdev Map
------------------
* Stdev map displayed via window is correct, but the jpeg saved to file is wrong
* Cannot save ROI made on the stdev map
* colormaps should be listed in a seperate script (make exstensible)
* Map window always in focus (cannot bring main window in front of it)
* In windows th gradient bar is stuck in the top left. Move the image and it moves to the right spot

Video Player
------------------
* df_fo displays a flicker in the background; all values aren't normalized across frames
